Additional Information:
Formal writing almost always uses Standard Written Chinese, even when the spoken language is Cantonese. This keeps government, political, and news text uniform and widely intelligible, leaving genuine written Cantonese mostly to informal media and user-generated content.

To see a partially completed example, look at the Welsh entry.

Sometimes asking a Large Language Model can be helpful: "What are some top websites written in the Welsh language?"

What kind of websites are you looking for?
If you look at the template, we have requested urls in a few categories: News, Culture/History, Government, Political Parties, and Other. Remember that we're looking for websites in this particular language. If the language is only a part of the website, and that's visible in the URL as https://example.com/catalan/, then that's the URL you should add.

For a language like Hindi, with 500 million speakers, there are a lot of websites to choose from. Please suggest websites that are important and influential, and please think about diversity. Are all geographic regions represented?

For a country-wide language like Hungarian, there are still probably a wide variety of websites to choose from. If a website is all English, however, that's not what we're looking for.

For a regional language like Catalan, things are trickier. Catalan has multiple names -- it's called Valencian in some parts of Spain -- and use of the Catalan language is a part of a vigorous debate in Spanish national and regional politics. You might not be able to find Catalan-language content for every political party, and government websites might offer Catalan content one day and remove it after the next election. In that case, please do the best you can.

If your favorite language has its own Wikipedia -- check the list here -- please include this link under "Other".
